    - Homework 3: [Information retrieval system on Twitter]()
  
      In this project, we will implement various retrieval system over the tweets dataset. After that we will evaluate the performance of each of the retrieval systems with some queries and MMR metric.

    - Homework 4: [Classification on Twitter]()
      
      In this project, we want to classify tweets into positive and negative sentiment using two methods. First, we will use a regression model to predict the sentiment of a tweet. Second, we will use an transformer-based model. Steps of the process are:

      - Homework 5: [Twitter_Interaction_Analysis]()
     
        In this project we are asked to analyse interactions between some Twitter users and generate the interaction graph of these users.
        After generating the desired graph, we can easily find the most refrenced user (a user with most refrences in the graph).
